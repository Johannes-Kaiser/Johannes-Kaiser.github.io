Personal
======
I am a PhD Student at the chair of Ai in Medicine and Healthcare at the Technical University of Munich and fortunate, to be co-supervised by Georgios Kaissis and Daniel RÃ¼ckert. My research interst lie in trustworthy ai with a focus on healthcare. Herein I investigate the application of differential privacy and its implications on fairness of machine learning models.
When not thinking about differential privacy or philosophysing about the implications of data use and misuse in medicine, I contribute my time volunteering in climate activism as well as youth work.
