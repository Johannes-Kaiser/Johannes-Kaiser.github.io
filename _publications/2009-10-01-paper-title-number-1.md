This bookchapter delves into the application of Differential Privacy (DP) in
the realm of medical imaging. It begins by outlining the challenges inherent
in leveraging large datasets for AI development in medicine while adhering
to privacy and confidentiality constraints. The concept of DP is introduced
as a robust mathematical framework designed to provide rigorous privacy
guarantees. Then, the unique properties of DP are discussed, including its
resilience to post-processing, compositional nature, and the quantifiable
approach to privacy management through a privacy budget. The chapter
further explores the integration of DP in deep learning, particularly in the
training of neural networks using differentially private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), and addresses the challenges of DP, including the
privacy-utility trade-off and fairness considerations. Selected applications
of DP in medical image analysis are highlighted, demonstrating its practical efficacy and necessity in protecting sensitive patient data. The chapter
concludes with a discussion on the evolving nature of DP, underscoring its
potential for more tailored privacy guarantees and higher model utility in
complex medical imaging applications.
